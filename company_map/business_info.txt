NordicTech Solutions specializes in developing AI-driven solutions that automate repetitive and time-consuming business processes. The companyâ€™s flagship product, AI-Workflow, is a cloud-based SaaS platform that seamlessly integrates with existing business systems such as ERP, CRM, and accounting software.
