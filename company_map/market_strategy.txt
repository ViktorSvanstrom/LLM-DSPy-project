Market Strategy
NordicTech Solutions employs a multifaceted strategy to reach and attract customers:
Direct Sales: A dedicated sales team works closely with customers to tailor solutions and demonstrate the value of AI-Workflow through personalized presentations and pilot projects.
Digital Marketing: The company invests in targeted campaigns via social media, search engine optimization (SEO), and content marketing to build brand awareness.
Partnerships: Strategic collaborations with local business system providers, such as Visma and Fortnox, facilitate the integration of AI-Workflow and increase its accessibility.
Freemium Model: A free basic version of AI-Workflow is offered to attract new customers, with premium features available through subscriptions starting at SEK 500 per month, depending on the companyâ€™s size and needs.
To further strengthen its brand, NordicTech Solutions plans to participate in international tech conferences such as Slush in Helsinki and Web Summit in Lisbon in 2026. These events will be used to showcase AI-Workflow, forge partnerships, and attract new investors.
