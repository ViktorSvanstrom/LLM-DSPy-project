One approach is to have a calm conversation with your mother when you aren’t feeling under pressure. Explain gently that your depression is a personal matter and that discussing it can be difficult for you. Emphasize that it's not about her, but rather your own process. You could suggest alternative ways for her to support you, like just being there to listen without asking questions. Use \"I\" statements to express how you feel, such as \"I feel overwhelmed when I am questioned about my feelings,\" which might help to minimize defensiveness on her part. If she continues to instigate conversations despite your boundaries, it may be necessary to reinforce those boundaries by stating clearly that you will not engage in those conversations and need her to respect that. Ultimately, remember that your mental well-being is a priority, and it's okay to maintain space when you need it.\n",
